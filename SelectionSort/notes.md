# Selection sort 
```
1. it is a type of greedy alorithm.

2. In this algorithm, the array is divided into two parts, first is sorted part, and another one is the unsorted part. 

3. Initially, the sorted part of the array is empty, and unsorted part is the given array.

4. Sorted part is placed at the left, while the unsorted part is placed at the right.

5. The average and worst-case complexity of selection sort is O(n2), where n is the number of items. Due to this, it is not suitable for large data sets.

sort is generally used when -

   * A small array is to be sorted

   * Swapping cost doesn't matter

   * It is compulsory to check all elements
